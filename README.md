# serodynamics

[![Project Status: Active â€“ While the package currently provides a set
of fundamental functions, we are actively working on expanding its
capabilities with more advanced tools for a comprehensive understanding
of your
results.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

`serodynamics` is a Bayesian modeling framework to infer influenza virus
infection status, antibody dynamics, and individual infection risks from
serological data, by accounting for measurement error. This could
identifiy influenza infections by relaxing 4-fold rise rule, and
quantifies the contributions of age and pre-epidemic
hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) titers to infection risk.

## Installation

1.  Install \[R\]\[r-project\]

2.  Install the development version of serodynamics from
    [GitHub](https://github.com/timktsang/serodynamics):

<!-- -->

    devtools::install_github("timktsang/serodynamics")
    library(serodynamics)

## Example

This is a basic example of how to load some serological data and fitting
the model using the MCMC framework.

    library(serodynamics)

    ## Load in a data set and flu activity data
    data("inputdata")
    data("flu_activity")

    ###### run the MCMC to estimate parameter of the model
    mcmc_result <- sero_dynamics(inputdata,inputILI, 2000,1000,1)

    ##### obtain the model estimate from fitted MCMC result
    extract_mcmc_result <- output_model_estimate(mcmc_result)
