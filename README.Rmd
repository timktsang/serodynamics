# seroreconstruct

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

`seroreconstruct` is a Bayesian modeling framework to infer influenza virus infection status, antibody dynamics, and individual infection risks from serological data, by accounting for measurement error. This could identifiy influenza infections by relaxing 4-fold rise rule, and quantifies the contributions of age and pre-epidemic hemagglutination-inhibiting (HAI) titers to infection risk. 
 
While the package currently provides a set of fundamental functions, we are actively working on expanding its capabilities with more advanced tools for a comprehensive understanding of your results.
 
## Installation
1. Install [R][r-project]

2. Install the development version of seroreconstruct from [GitHub](https://github.com/timktsang/seroreconstruct):

```{r installation,eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("timktsang/seroreconstruct")
library(seroreconstruct)
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to load some serological data and fitting the model using the MCMC framework.

```{r example, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
library(seroreconstruct)

## Load in a data set and flu activity data
data("inputdata")
data("flu_activity")

###### run the MCMC to estimate parameter of the model
###### in actual analysis, number of iteration is 200000, burnin is 100000, and thinning is 10
mcmc_result <- sero_reconstruct(inputdata,flu_activity, 2000,1000,1)

##### obtain the model estimate from fitted MCMC result
extract_mcmc_result <- output_model_estimate(mcmc_result)

```
